# SCINet GeoCDL

The SCINet Geospatial Common Data Library (GeoCDL) effort is focused on establishing a centralized data library of commonly used geospatial data (Climate, EO such as Landsat/Sentinel/Modis, Landuse-change, etc...) in associated with the USDA ARS SCINet initiative. The objective is to make this library accessible from USDA ARS HPC systems and provide high-performance / high throughput data to computing infrastructure.

If involved with this effort, please feel free to raise questions in the [Discussion Section](https://github.com/rmg55/SCINet_GeoCDL/discussions) or if there is an error/issue with the code, in the [Issue Section](https://github.com/rmg55/SCINet_GeoCDL/issues)

### Benchmarking
Currently the focus of this effort is on benchmarking different approaches to building, hosting, and accessing this library. This can be found in the `./throughput_benchmarks` section.
