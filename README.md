# SCINet GeoCDL

The SCINet Geospatial Common Data Library (GeoCDL) effort is focused on establishing a centralized data library of commonly used geospatial data (Climate, EO such as Landsat/Sentinel/Modis, Landuse-change, etc...) in associated with the USDA ARS SCINet initiative. The objective is to make this library accessible from USDA ARS HPC systems and provide high-performance / high throughput data to computing infrastructure.

Currently the focus of this effort is on benchmarking different approaches to building, hosting, and accessing this library.

If involved with this effort, please feel free to raise questions in the [Discussion Section](https://github.com/rmg55/SCINet_GeoCDL/discussions) or if there is an error/issue with the code, in the [Issue Section](https://github.com/rmg55/SCINet_GeoCDL/issues)
